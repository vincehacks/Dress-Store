## Dress Store Iteration 1
This iteration was my first attempt at creating the Dress-Store. The user only
has one dress to choose from. After the user selects through the dress options
and clicks on the next button, the shipping form is shown. The user will click
on the finish button and a summary of what they purchased will appear on the
screen.
